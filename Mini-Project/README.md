# ASL-Recognition
### Project Overview

 In this project, I’ve created a machine learning model that recognizes sign language that is followed by the American Sign Language (ASL) format, from images. The model takes in an image and then predicts which alphabet or number is represented by that gesture. In this way, people who don’t understand Sign Language will be able to understand and interpret them using the machine learning model. Hence, this will gap the bridge of communication that exists in today’s world.


### Problem Statement
To create a machine learning model that will be able to recognize the hand signs from images in the American Sign Language format.

- To find a dataset having sufficient images following the ASL format. 
- To study about Neural Networks and how it can be used. 
- To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- To learn about Transfer Learning. 
- To create a model which gives a good accuracy. 
- To test the model’s accuracy on unseen(test) data
